            <p>What is this website? This website will show you the environmental problems that are slowly killing our only home, The Earth and how to help it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The problem of pollution is that people don't know how much they are actually harming the environment.
            There's not much awareness about the direct and indirect consequences of people's actions because they may not understand how much impact they do due to too much daily information. Further more, not everyone knows how much waste is released into the nature because of their daily choices. There's a lot of ways that The Earth is being polluted like throwing rubbish into the ocean or the gases that are released from vehicles. 
            For example, when a person is driving his car, CO2 and other gases are released. It may not look harmful when one person oes it but when millions or billions of people do it, it becomes a big threat for the environment. 
            Because of gases like this there's the "Green house effect" that holds the heat of The Earth instead of it leaving the atmosphere which causes a lot of damage to the ecosystem. 
            If this continues, soon we won't be able to live normal and that is why we must stop polluting and reduce the damage we make.</p>
