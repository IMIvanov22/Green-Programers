            <p>The problem of pollution is that people don't know how much they are actually harming the environment.
            There's not much awareness about the direct and indirect consequences of people's actions because they may not understand how much impact they do due to too much daily information. Furthermore, not everyone knows how much waste is released into the nature because of their daily choices. 
            There are a lot of ways that The Earth is being polluted like throwing rubbish into the ocean or the gases that are released from vehicles. 
            For example, when a person is driving his car, CO2 and other gases are released. It may not look harmful when one person does it but when millions or billions of people do it, it becomes a big threat to the environment. 
            Because of gases like this, there's the "Greenhouse effect" that holds the heat of The Earth instead of it leaving the atmosphere which causes a lot of damage to the ecosystem. 
            If this continues, soon we won't be able to live normally and that is why we must stop polluting and reduce the damage we make.</p>
            <br>
            <p>How can you help? There are a lot of ways you can help save the planet. One of the easiest ways to do this is to recycle as much as possible. 
            This will not only help the rubbish to be separated in a way to be disposed of but it will also help with making recycled products that will be safer for the environment, easily degradable, and will not need a new source for their creation. 
            There's even a safe way to drive. As time passes, we as humans get more advanced in technology and we create things that we haven't imagined before. One of the best inventions for protecting the nature and transporting people is the electric cars. 
            They are reducing air pollution as they are powered by electricity and not fossil fuels.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So this website shows the bad consequences of the choices we make in our daily lives and the best we can do to protect our little home, our blue little dot.</p>
